# UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) Project

The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) project is a hardware implementation of a UART communication module. It enables serial communication between a microcontroller or a computer and external devices using the UART protocol so it sends bit by bit .

This project showcases the design and implementation of a UART transmitter and receiver module using hardware description language (HDL) and a hardware simulation tool. It provides a foundation for understanding the principles and techniques involved in UART communication.

In this project i had to implement a Baud Rate Generator and FIFO for Tx and Rx as provided in the UART construction.

The Baud Rate Generator is only a Tick Timer which ticks until it reaches the final value then a flag is high.

## Usage
1. Open the simulation tool and load the project files.
2. Simulate the provided testbenches or create your own test scenarios.
3. Analyze the simulation results to observe the behavior of the UART transmitter and receiver.
4. Modify the design files to experiment with different configurations or features.
